Computer hardware and software stuff that I am using, inspired by [[https://uses.tech][uses.tech]]. Since this is ~/uses~, not ~/recommendations~, do not take everything here as a direct endorsement.

* My Machines
This includes computers for my personal use as well as homelab/server things.
** My Laptop
My current laptop is a Thinkpad T430 that got me through my last 1^{1/2}-ish years of undergrad. I bought it for $100 off of Kijiji in Summer 2023, and have spent more money on a few upgrades and repairs since then. I started with Qubes-OS to compartmentalize my workflows, and now I'm using Secureblue Sericea (Sway). I always love using window managers for efficiency on my laptops, I used AwesomeWM on Qubes and I now use Sway with Secureblue. 
- *Thinkpad T430*
- *CPU:* Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3840QM (4) @ 3.80 GHz
- *RAM:* 16GB DDR3
- *OS:* Secureblue (previously Qubes-OS)
- *Storage:* 500GB

I previously used a Thinkpad T400 that I librebooted but it died like a year ago. 🙁
** PC (Destkop+Homelab)
I built a PC that I use as a hypervisor server running Proxmox for local LLM inferencing, gaming on Bazzite, Jellyfin LXC for hardware transcoding, and backup PiHole+Unbound DNS.
Here is the build:
- *Case:* Corsair 4000D Airflow
- *Motherboard:* MSI Pro Z790-P
- *CPU:* Intel i7 12700K
- *Cooler:* Thermalight Peerless Assasin 120 SE
- *GPU:* Radeon RX 7900 XTX
- *Power Supply:* Corsair RM860e
- *RAM:* 32 GB DDR5
- *OS:* Proxmox VE 9
** PC (Homelab+NAS)
I got a somewhat ancient hand-me-down of a PC which I've repurposed as a NAS for the family and use for my homelab stuff. Nothing to super write home about but it gets the job done.
- *CPU:* Intel i5-4570 (4) @ 3.600GHz
- *RAM:* 32GB DDR3
- *OS:* Proxmox VE 9
- *Storage:* 500GB SSD (OS), 2x4TB ZFS Mirror Pool (Storage, managed by TrueNAS VM)
** SBC (Homelab)
I first started homelabbing with my RockPro64 running DietPi, still mess around with it but it's not running anything too mission critical currently.
** Firewall/Router
I have a custom router at home for better customizability and security compared to the default modems provided by ISPs. I use this for setting firewall rules, VLANs, Wi-Fi Networks, and VPN access.
